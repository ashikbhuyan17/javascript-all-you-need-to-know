stack
What is stack with example?
A stack is an abstract data type that holds an ordered,
linear sequence of items. In contrast to a queue,
a stack is a last in, first out (LIFO) structure.
A real-life example is a stack of plates: you can only take 
plate from the top of the stack, and you can only add a plate 
to the top of the stack.
